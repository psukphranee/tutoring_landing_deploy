        description : "I am a graduate student in Mathematics at San Francisco State University, where I also teach Pre-Calculus and a Calculus I Lab. In addition to my work at the university, I am a Math Teacher at C2 Education, where I help students prepare for exams such as the ACT, SAT, and AP Calculus AB/BC. With experience working with students from 1st grade to college freshman, both in private and public schools across California, I have helped many students achieve their academic goals and go on to top universities. My passion for teaching and helping students succeed drives me to continuously improve my skills and knowledge."
